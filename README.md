## Installation

Simply clone or download the zip and place directly on the root of your hardrive.
If you prefer, you can place the scripts elsewhere but you will need to edit the 
scripts.
Make sure if you download the zip file that you delete the "-master" off the end of 
the folder or the scripts will fail. If you use git to clone the project you will not
have that issue.
Launch.bat is the script that will launch both zookeeper and kafka delaying kafka by 15
seconds to give zookeeper sufficient time to start up.
I recommend creating a shortcut and placing it wherever it is most convenient. 

## Kafka version
I have included the latest version of Kafka but you can replace with the version 
of Kafka you need just make sure to rename the parent folder so the scripts work.
